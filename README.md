# Computer Animation

This project was made during the [Computer Animation](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/masters/master-innovation-and-research-informatics/curriculum/syllabus/CA-MIRI) course of the [Master in Innovation and Research in Informatics](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/masters/master-innovation-and-research-informatics/) at the [Faculty of Informatics of Barcelona](https://www.fib.upc.edu) of the [Polytechnic University of Catalunya](https://www.upc.edu/en).

## Project Structure

```
build - Directory for built and compressed files from the npm build script
src - Directory for all dev files
├── css - Contains all SCSS files, that are compiled to `src/public/css`
├── js - All the Three.js app files, with `app.js` as entry point. Compiled to `src/public/js` with webpack
│   ├── app
│   │   ├── components - Three.js components that get initialized in `main.js`
│   │   ├── helpers - Classes that provide ideas on how to set up and work with defaults
│   │   ├── managers - Manage complex tasks such as GUI or input
│   │   └── model - Classes that set up the model object
│   ├── data - Any data to be imported into app
│   └── utils - Various helpers and vendor classes
└── public - Used by webpack-dev-server to serve content. Webpack builds local dev files here.
    └── assets - Is copied over to build folder with build command. Place external asset files here.
```

## Getting started

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Then run dev script:

```
npm run dev
```

Spins up a webpack dev server at localhost:8080 and keeps track of all js and sass changes to files.

## Build

```
npm run build
```

Cleans existing build folder while linting js folder and copies over the public assets folder from src. Then sets environment to production and compiles js and css into build.

## Other NPM Scripts

You can run any of these individually if you'd like with the `npm run` command:

- `prebuild` - Cleans up build folder and lints `src/js`
- `clean` - Cleans build folder
- `lint` - Runs lint on the `src/js` folder and uses the `.eslintrc` file in root for linting rules
- `webpack-server` - Start up a webpack-dev-server with hot-module-replacement
- `webpack-watch` - Run webpack in dev environment with watch
- `dev:js` - Run webpack in dev environment without watch
- `build:dir` - Copy files and folders from `src/public` to `build`
- `build:js` - Run webpack in production environment

## Input Controls

- Press H to hide dat.GUI
- Arrow controls will pan
- Mouse left click will rotate/right click will pan
- Scroll wheel zooms in and out

Implemented with the help of the [Three.js Webpack ES6 Boilerplate](https://github.com/paulmg/ThreeJS-Webpack-ES6-Boilerplate/).
